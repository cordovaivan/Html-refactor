# Html-refactor week 1 challenge

This is a simple readme file for week 1 challenge, in this challenge we were asked to refactor the HTML and CSS of a given website.

To View this project you can follow the following link [Html Refactor](https://cordovaivan.github.io/Html-refactor/)

The Original Html and CSS files given in this project did not follow accessibility standards and did not have the correct semantic html elements.

## Here is a list of the changes that were made.

* Deleted the div at the end of Html and replaced it with a footer.
* Changed classed to IDs since they were a more unique element in the code.
* Relisted headers so they fell in sequential order.
* Added alts to img elements in Html
* Condensed CSS and Added comments to css so that the next devolper will be more able to easily understand changes that were made.
